Each category in the rubric is equally important in our 21st Century and thus scored equally. The <A HREF= "myfiles/PresentationRubric.docx">rubric</A> also includes a comments section for each evaluated category but it is strongly recommended that one-on-one conferences or group conferences be provided by the teacher. Please note: the rubric will print on two pages unless you print on 9x17 paper.</FONT></P>
