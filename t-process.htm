   <LI><FONT FACE="verdana,arial,helvetica">Your group is responsible for choosing 3 of the figurative language types below to create the PowerPoint that you will use to teach the incarcerated graffiti artists. You will need to research each of the three types and create a definition, show some examples of what that type of figurative language looks like, and then come up with an activity for the incarcerated artists to complete that will help them practice using the figurative language correctly.
